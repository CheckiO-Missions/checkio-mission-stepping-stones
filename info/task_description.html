<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    This task is adapted from following video with Neil Sloane (founder of the <a target="_blank" href="https://oeis.org">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>), that you should watch first to learn, how this excellent puzzle works.

<p style="text-align: justify">
    You have got a certain number of ðŸŸ¤ stones (1 point each) anywhere on the board. Now you add âšª stones with increasing points value (2, 3, 4 ...) on the board. The rule of placement is: you can only put down a âšª stone with value <b class="code">k</b> if sum of values of its eight neighbors (ðŸŸ¤ and/or âšª) is <b class="code">k</b>. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
    To keep this problem manageable, the placement of stones is restricted into a finite <b class="code">n * n</b> chessboard, whose edges the stones cannot cross into the void. As usual, rows and columns are numbered starting from zero.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
    Starting the placement from stone number <b class="code">2</b>, consecutively (no value skipping allowed) numbered stones are placed on board in ascending order so that the moment that the stone number <b class="code">k</b> is placed somewhere, the stones previously placed into its up to eight neighboring locations add up to exactly <b class="code">k</b>.
</p>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
    Given the board size <b class="code">n</b> and the initial coordinates of the ðŸŸ¤<b class="code">ones</b>, your function should return the highest numbered stone in the longest sequence of stones that can be placed consecutively on the board within the rules of the puzzle.
